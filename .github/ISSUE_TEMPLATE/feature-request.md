We want to hear your ideas about where VisiData can go and anything you think could be made smoother.
We consider all ideas that are feasible, but please don't be offended if we close it--we generally limit our open issues to bugs and small concrete feature requests that are part of the planned roadmap.

If you want to propose a command, please include:

- [] what should the helpstring say
- [] where should this command go in the menu system
